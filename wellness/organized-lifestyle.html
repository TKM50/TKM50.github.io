<h2>CLEAN YOUR SPACE</h2>
<p>Cleaning your space is the most important activity to keep you organized and motivated.  For me, when my apartment is not clean it is hard to focus.  When you see clutter all over the place while you are trying to study, it takes your mind away from what you are trying to focuse on.  After a long day of school or work you want to come home to a clean house and a comfortable bed to sleep in.  You dont want to do chores when you come home.  So clean up as you go.  Do your laundry once a week and clean every dish so that you're not always weighed down with heavy cleaning.  These are lifestyle changes you can make to help keep your mind focused.</p>

<h2>KEEP A PLANNER</h2>
<p>Having a planner is also essential to being a boss babe.  Although you may feel like you have everything under control, you probably don't if you dont have a planner.  Planners are a necessity because they help balance your work and social life.  I keep a color coded planner on my iPhone with blue as school and work and pink for social events.  Dark purple is for trips and vaction and the brown color is for birthdays.  I also have lists of reminders so that I get a notification on my phone a day before an assignment is due.  Out of everything, this is the most important thing you can do to be successful in your life.</p>

<h2>ALWAYS MAKE A TO-DO</h2>
<p>Having a to-do list may seem excessive to some, but it works especially during finals week or days you may have to cram.  No matter what, you have to stick to your to-do list to get everything done.  But please, don't forget to give yourself long breaks!  This well help you stay motivated to do your work,  I recently downloaded an app called "Forest" which is built based on the Pomodoro technique.  The Pomodoro technique is broken down into different blocks of 25 minutes with a break in between.  You work as hard as you can for 25 minutes and you are rewarded with a small break.  On the Forest app, you can set a certain amount of time (max amount of time is an hour and a half) and it rewards you once you've completef your time.  If you pick up your phone the time shuts off and you loose a tree in your forest.  If you have focused for a long amount of time you are able to plant virtual trees and over a few weeks you will have created a forest.  Once you reach a certain about of hours you can use your tokens to plant a real tree in an actual forest.  It is by far my favorite app and I recommend it to any student!

<h2>KEEP YOUR SCHOOLWORK ORGANIZED</h2>
<p>Before the start of any school year, I make sure to purchase new notebooks and pencils.  This helps me stay organzied.  Although most things are electronic now, it is always good to keep a notebook.  When I invest in nice notebooks and pencils it makes me excited to start a new semester. </p>
