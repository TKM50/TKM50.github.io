        <p>There are a lot of benefits to burning incense.  Before I begin studying, I always light some incense because it helps me stay focused.  This is because of the Rose and Lotus embedded in the incense.  These woods are known to increase concentration.  Incense also helps reduce stress and anxiety; the Cedarwood and Sandwood have relaxing properties in them.  These relaxing properties help reduce heart rate and calm the nerves and tension in muscles.  When I am working on homework in my graphic design class, I light my Agarwood incense because this wood helps promote creativity.</p>

      <h2>PAMPER YOURSELF</h2>
        <p>One thing some busy women forget to do is pamper themselves!  After a week of commotion, I always find time to do things for myself, like my nails.  Pampering yourself boosts your confidence and makes you more inclined to leave your bed and get things done.   I also like to take every Sunday morning for a spa day.  During this spa day I take time to steam and deep condition my hair and use my Aztec Indian clay mask on my face.</p>

      <h2>MEDITATE</h2>
        <p>Meditation is something that I want to get more into.  There are many benefits to meditating: reduces stress, improves your memory, imporoves mindfullness, and makes you happier.  If you want to start meditationg, start off slow.  You can start with just one to to two minutes.  Focus on your breathing and relax your mind.  It's okay to let your thoughts flow because it helps promote concentration. </p>

      <h2>COUNT YOUR BLESSINGS -- LITERALLY</h2>
        <p>Once a week I try to take five minutes out of my day to count my blessings.  Although I do not suffer from depression myself, this could help people who do change how they look at things.  When you wakeup and write down everything that you are greatful for, it makes you realize how small your "problems" actually are.  For example, when I wakeup and realize I have a comfortable bed to sleep in and a roof over my head, my stress feel small. </p>

      <h2>TAKE A BATH</h2>
        <p>During my spa days, I add essential oils like tea tree oil and lavendar oil to my bath tub.  I also add himalayn rock crystals in my water.  This creates a very good smelling and relaxing bath tub.  It helps improve energy and sleep.  Adding natural elements into the bathtub helps give you the upmost reaction.  Baths are essential for a focused and determined mindset.  They are also the perfect break for after a long period of studying.  I also have other natural ingrediants like goat milk that I like to add for soft skin.  Try lighting incense for and even better expierence.</p>

      <h2>INVEST IN PLANTS</h2>
        <p>I add a bunch of lavendar in a mason jar by my bathtub.  This gives me the feeling of an all around spa expierence.  The smell reduce stress and anxiety and alleviates insomia.</p>
        <p>Plants are one of the best pieces of decoration you could have in your apartment or home in my opinion.  They help clean the air and promote easy breathing because they produce more oxygen.  Some people even say that having plants around their places makes them feel relaxed and safe.  I grow fresh chives in my kitchen to add to my meals.  Growing plants is relaxing and helps you become responsible because they need care.  They're also known to bring good luck!</p>

      <h2>GET A PET (IF YOU CAN HANDLE ONE)</h2>
        <p>You should consider buying a pet, especially if you live alone.  Even though they don't talk, they are the best support system.  There are a few benefits of having a pet that a lot of people do not know about.  One of them is that they increase serotonin and dopamine levels.  These help imporve your mood and relax you.  They help reduce anxiety because they bring you comfort. I talk to my dog all the time because he helps me not feel so lonely while living alone.</p>
