      <h2>EAT FRUITS</h2>
        <p>Fruits are a meal on their own.  They help detoxify the body by giving the body Potassium, Iron, and  energy.  They also help promote healthy skin, nails and hair.  They are the perfect replacement for candy.  So whenever you feel like opening that bag of skittles, just think about eating a pineapple or orange to cure your sweet tooth.</p>

      <h2>DRINK GREEN TEA</h2>
        <p>I have one to two cups of green tea every day.  Green tea helps relax my body and boost my metabolism.  It helps me stay away from coffee and keep me focused.  I have noticed whenever I drink coffee I become jittery and anxious so this was the perfect replacement because it does the opposite.  It also helps me get a better sleep at night so that I can wakeup and start my day early.  Waking up at 6:00am versus 10:00am gives you four extra hours of day light to get work done!</p>

      <h2>DRINK WATER</h2>
        <p>Water is important to for your body's health.  Whenever I feel myself feeling lathargic I realize its because I haven't drank much water.  Drinking out of a copper water bottle has a lot of health benefits: boosts brain health, improves immunity, slows down aging, and strengthens heart functioning.</p>

      <h2>EAT EVERYTHING IN MODERATION</h2>
        <p>Many people become miserable with strict diets, but if you eat everything in moderaation you will be happy and healthy.  For example, during the week I am on my diet, but during the weekend I can enjoy whatever foods I want.  This practice keeps my weight where I want it and my energy levels where I need them to be.  Sticking to a laid back diet helps give the diet longeivity so that it becomes a lifestyle change.</p>

      <h2>TRY STICKING TO HOMECOOKED MEALS</h2>
        <p>Eating at home is known to be a much healthier option than eating out.  When you cook your own meals you know everything that you are putting in your food.  You can decide whether you want to add certain amounts of butter or salt verus when you go to a restraunt, you have no idea how the dishes were prepared.  The best way to start a diet is to get used to cooking at home.  I grow my own fresh herbs in my kitchen.  These herbs add so much flavor to all of my dishes and make cooking enjoyable.</p>

      <h2>DRINK APPLE CIDER VINEGAR</h2>
        <p>Along with my green tea and water intake, I also try to have a smoothie atleast four times a week.  The main ingrediant in these smoothies is the apple cider vingear.  This ingrediant has many health benefits: treats heartburn, detoxifies the liver, lowers blood pressure, breaks down fat, and reduces cholestrol.  I have noticed serious changes in my body after taking this vinegar.  I take my fruits and organize them into small bags so that all I have to do is throw them into the blender when I'm ready.</p>
